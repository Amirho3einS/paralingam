# PARALiNGAM
This is the implementation of the ParaLiNGAM algorithm. The algorithm is described in the paper "ParaLiNGAM: Parallel Causal Structure Learning for Linear non-Gaussian Acyclic Models" by A. Shahbazinia, S. Salehkaleybar, and M. Hashemi.



# Compile & Executable

First, make run.bash executable:

$ chmod +x run.bash

Next, execute run.bash and select the desired experiment. Select 0 for Real Dataset (ParaLiNGAM), 1 for Synthetic (ParaLiNGAM), 2 for Impact of threshold mechanism (ParaLiNGAM), 3 for ParaLiNGAM Vs Baseline methods, 4 for  Real Dataset (DirectLiNGAM), 5 for Synthetic(DirectLiNGAM), 6 for  Real Dataset (DirectLiNGAM Optimized), and 7 for Synthetic(DirectLiNGAM Optimized).
